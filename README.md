## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **ali** and I'm a devoted software engineer with more than 20 years of expierience.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on

In my professional career, I've traveled across paradigm universes using languages such as: `c#`, `t/pl/sql`, `javascript`, `typescript`, etc, to mention a few. 

I've also worked with different tools & frameworks like `.net`, `rabbitmq`, `docker`, `kubernetes`, etc, to name a few.

I'd love to continue the exploration of these tools, frameworks, and paradigms, to enhance my skillsets.

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
In my spare time, I'm exploring new languages such as `go` to expand my horizon.

Having worked with `async` programming in `c#`, I am quiet familiar with concurrent exectution &amp; blocking threads; however, in `.net`; you have to make sure you understand blocking calls to use `async` and `await` correctly. I really want to learn how **goroutines** have been able to solve this problem.

I'd also love to learn more about go's package management solution. In my opinion, `nuget` is overblown, and over-engineered.

## ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on
If there is a project in `.net`, `postgres`, `aws`, or `go`, that you need help with; please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
