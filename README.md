## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **ali** and I'm a devoted software engineer with more than 20 years of expierience.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on

In my professional career, I've traveled across paradigm universes using languages such as: `c#`, `t/pl/sql`, `javascript`, `typescript`, etc, to mention a few. I've also worked with different tools & frameworks like `.net`, `rabbitmq`, `docker`, `kubernetes`, etc, to name a few.

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
In my spare time, I'm exploring new languages such as `go` to expand my horizon. I'd like to put to gether a complete prototype using `go`, postgres database, and a typescript front-end.

## ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on
If there is a project in `.net`, `postgres`, `aws`, or `go`, that you need help with; please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
